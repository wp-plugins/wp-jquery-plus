Loads jQuery from Google using the exact jQuery version as your current WordPress install while still maintaining backwards comptability for the core WP jQuery library

== Description ==

There’s been a whole heap of discussions about the "correct" way to load jQuery onto your site. I thought I’d throw my solution into the ring. What this plugin does differently than others is it loads jQuery from Google - while providing a fallback to the local version in the event the CDN is down or you are not allowed to access Google (like in China). It also uses the same version as WordPress does - automagically.

**WordPress 3.5 is now required for protocol relative URLs**

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-jquery-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you add `feature-x`? =

Sure! I'm always open to knew ideas. Just create a new forum post and I'll take a gander.
