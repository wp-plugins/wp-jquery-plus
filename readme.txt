Loads jQuery from Google using the exact jQuery version as your current WordPress install while still maintaining backwards comptability for the core WP jQuery library

== Description ==

There’s been a [whole heap of discussions](http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-load-scripts-in-wordpress-themes) recently about the "correct" way to load jQuery onto your site. I thought I’d throw my solution into the ring. What this plugin does differently than others is it loads jQuery from Google - while still maintaining backwards compatability for the core WP jQuery library AND uses the core WP jQuery version!

You must have CURL enabled on your server.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-jquery-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Sure! I'm always open to knew ideas. Just create a new forum post and I'll take a gander.
